By reducing the number of dimensions in your feature space, you have fewer relationships between variables to consider and you are less likely to overfit your model. It also help with visualize data because you can reduce the dimensionality to 1-3 dimensions so you can easily visualize it.\n","\n","Dimensionality Reduction can be divided into two groups:\n","\n","- Feature Selection\n","- Feature Extraction\n","\n","Feature Selection does what its name sounds like. It tries to find a subset of the original features. There are three strategies to select features. There is the filter, wrapper and embedded strategy. Feature Selection has a few advantages and disadvantages over feature extraction. The advantages of feature selection include its simplicity and its interpretability of the features. One of its disadvantages is that you lose all information from the features you dropped which possibly results in worse accuracy.\n","\n","Feature Extraction we create new features that are combinations of all the old features. We order the new features by how well they help predict the dependent variable (y). So we can reduce the dimensionality by choosing how many of the new features to keep and how many of the less important new features to delete. But eventhough we are deleting some of the new features we are still keeping most of the information because the new features are combinations of all the old features."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PaQUt8UU6D0d","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Principal component analysis (PCA)\n","Principal component analysis is a technique for feature extraction.

Calculate covariance matrix.\n","   3. Calculate eigen vectors and eigen values\n","   4. Sort eigen values and their respective eigen vectors\n","   5. Choose new dimensionality ( by selecting the first k eigen vectors)\n","   6. Transform original data\n","### Ways to choose the new dimensionality\n","- Select an arbitrary number of features (dimensions)\n","- Select a threshold of variance to maintain and add features until you reach the threshold\n","### Using PCA in Scikit Learn\n","Scikit Learn has multiple version of PCA. It has the normal PCA, IncrementalPCA which allows for partial computations (so you don't need to load the full dataset into memory), KernelPCA which allows for non-linear dimensionality reduction through the use of kernels as well as two versions of SparsePCA which goal is the extraction of the set of sparse components that best reconstruct the data."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"MVMQqjBh6D0e","colab_type":"code","outputId":"37f50a7b-366b-4e48-e897-61f199d513b8","colab":{}},"source":["from IPython.display import HTML\n","\n","HTML('<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xebPVQ1f7nM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/home/kroom54/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/IPython/core/display.py:689: UserWarning: Consider using IPython.display.IFrame instead\n","  warnings.warn(\"Consider using IPython.display.IFrame instead\")\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xebPVQ1f7nM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":1}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uqDzxQRW6D0i","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### 1.
